This is an alternate project as proposed to Terry.

The idea is to learn more about data binding and XML by working through
the projects in Ch25 and Ch26.

The project files, sources and binaries are in the folders Ch25 and Ch26.

In fact, after working through the examples, I realize the textbook only
scratches the surface of these topics. But it does provide a good foundation
for further investigation.

Areas for additional study:
1) Difference between using Windows control "Data Source" vs "Data Binding"
   properties.
2) More in depth study of how C# models database processing via the 3
   classes - SqlConnection, SqlDataSet and SqlDataAdapter. The basics are
   covered in the textbook.
3) Some of the database examples are done by manually coding the data bindings.
   After that, the Form Designer is disconnected and no longer shows the
   correct relationship. Is there a way to inform Form Desiger to update?
4) Learning the use of XML Designer
5) How to set and use a real xsd path. The examples point to http://tempuri.org,
   the default ASP.NET web services site.
6) Better methods for validation of XML schemas
      Ch26/RecordTimes tests the schema by creating an xml file and linking it
      to the schema. This is not really sufficient for identifying problems
      with the schema.
